This repository contains the organization charter, community guideline and developer process for all Block Foundation projects.

## Introduction

Welcome to the heart of the Block Foundation's principles and operational guidelines – the Charter Repository. This is where you will find the foundational documents outlining our mission, vision, values, strategies, and operational processes, providing a comprehensive guide to the ethos and rules that govern our organization.

Our Charter is a living document that encapsulates our commitment to democratizing architecture through blockchain technology. It is the blueprint we follow in our quest to tackle housing mismatches, and to reshape traditional constraints to create a more inclusive and dynamic real estate market.

In this repository, you will find detailed sections covering our mission statement, vision, and the core strategies we adopt to bring about change. It also outlines the rights, roles, and responsibilities of our contributors, setting the tone for respectful, productive collaborations that uphold our shared values.

Transparency and collaboration form the bedrock of the Block Foundation. Therefore, this Charter is not just a rulebook but also a platform for dialogue. We encourage our community members to explore the document, provide input, and help us refine our processes and goals. After all, the Block Foundation is not just about the few but the many who believe in a more sustainable and equitable real estate landscape.

We hope this Charter Repository serves as a clear guide to what we stand for, what we aim to achieve, and how we plan to get there. It's a reflection of our commitment to the journey we're embarking on together, a journey that seeks to revolutionize architecture and housing for the betterment of all.

Thank you for being a part of this journey, and for helping us shape a future where everyone has a fair stake in the world we build. Let's continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible, together!
